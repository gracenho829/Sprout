### 1. Introduction 
People living in modern society have a difficult time maintaining good habits. 
We developed a program that motivates the user to maintain a healthy habit to cultivate a healthy lifestyle.
We received our motifs from the study app , Forest. 


**1. Building Sprout**

Our team used Leap Motion and Unity to implement our program.

> Choose a seed that you wish to plant. 

![3icons](https://github.com/gracenho829/Sprout/blob/master/3icons.png)
> We provided 3 icons (sun, moon, and cloud) as a default. The sun represents the amount of exercise. The moon represents the amount of sleep. The cloud represents the amount of water you drank.

> The gauge on the left rises everytime you complete a task/mission. You can slide down on each icon up to 3 times per day.

### Limitations and Future Studies

Due to time constraints, we could not implement many functions such as an item shop. 
We also had some trouble with having our Leap Motion recognize our hand motions correctly.
For our future studies, we plan on experimenting with our Leap Motion so that we have different types of interaction to provide more functions and easier navigation.
