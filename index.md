### 1. Introduction 
People living in modern society have a difficult time maintaining good habits. 
We developed a program that motivates the user to maintain a healthy habit to cultivate a healthy lifestyle.
We received our motifs from the study app , Forest. 


**1. Building Sprout**
Our team used Leap Motion and Unity to implement our program.

### Limitations and Future Studies

Due to time constraints, we could not implement many functions such as an item shop. 
We also had some trouble with having our Leap Motion recognize our hand motions correctly.
For our future studies, we plan on experimenting with our Leap Motion so that we have different types of interaction to provide more functions and easier navigation.
